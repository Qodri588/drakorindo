<li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit our Designated Copyright Agent to identify the use being challenged;</li>
<li>A statement that you have not authorized the challenged use, and that you have a good-faith belief that the challenged use is not authorized by law; and</li>
<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that all of the information in the notification is accurate and, that you are the IP owner, or are authorized to act on behalf of the IP owner.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A registered user may respond to notice of takedown by showing either (a) that the claimant does not own the IP or (b) that the IP is not infringed. If the registered user succeeds in showing either (a), (b) or (c) then our Designated Copyright Agent may exercise its discretion not to remove the IP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If our Designated Copyright Agent decides to comply with a takedown request, it will do so within a reasonably expeditious period of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We Have No Obligation to Adjudicate IP Claims – User’s Agreement to Hold Us Harmless From Claims</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claimants and users must understand that we are not an intellectual property tribunal. While we and our Designated Copyright Agent may in our discretion use the information provided in order to decide how to respond to infringement claims, we are not responsible for determining the merits of such claims. If a user responds to a claim of infringement by providing assurances that its content is not infringing, the user agrees that if we thereafter restore or maintain the content, the user will defend and hold us harmless from any resulting claims of infringement brought against us and our Designated Copyright Agent.</p>
